                    current,
                    if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</h2>
                <p class="review-block__text">“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been
                    looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed
                    up for the free intro course and
                    found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most
                    grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working
                    as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</p>

                    progress which I find really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to
                    go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the
                    rest. You will get the personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing

                <p class="review-block__text" class="review-block__text">“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never
                    written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming
                    step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful
                    things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very
                    hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was
                    outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In
                    fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It
                    certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100%
                    recommend! ”</p>
